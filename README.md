 Capstone Project Report: Customers_Orders_Products Database

Project Overview

The Capstone Project, Customers_Orders_Products Database, aimed to create a comprehensive database system to manage customer information, orders, and product details. This project showcases proficiency in SQL database design, querying, and data manipulation techniques essential for effective business operations and analytics.

Why This Project?

Managing customer relationships and analyzing sales data are critical for business growth and decision-making. This project illustrates my capability to design and implement a database system that supports these functions efficiently. It demonstrates the ability to structure data to derive meaningful insights and drive strategic initiatives.

Entities and Database Design

Customers: Stores customer details including unique CustomerID, Name, and Email for effective customer management.

Orders: Tracks order-specific information such as OrderID, CustomerID, ProductName, OrderDate, and Quantity to manage sales transactions.

Products: Manages product information with ProductID, ProductName, and Price to support inventory and pricing strategies.

SQL Concepts Demonstrated

- DDL (Data Definition Language): Created database schema and defined tables (Customers, Orders, Products) with primary keys and data types to maintain data integrity.
  
- DML (Data Manipulation Language): Inserted realistic data into tables to simulate customer interactions and sales transactions.

- Joins: Utilized INNER JOIN to retrieve consolidated data across Customers, Orders, and Products tables for comprehensive sales analysis.

- Subqueries: Employed subqueries to retrieve specific data subsets and perform complex calculations (e.g., top customers by order quantity).

- Aggregate Functions: Used functions like SUM, AVG to calculate total quantities, average prices, and revenues from orders.

- Conditional Logic: Applied WHERE clauses to filter data based on specific criteria (e.g., orders placed on or after a certain date).

Tasks Addressed in the Project

4. Calculated total quantity of products ordered.
5. Retrieved names of customers who have placed orders.
6. Retrieved products with a price greater than $10.00.
7. Retrieved customer name and order date for orders placed on or after '2023-07-05'.
8. Calculated average price of all products.
9. Retrieved customer names along with total quantity of products they have ordered.
10. Retrieved products that have not been ordered.

Task 2: Advanced Data Analysis
1. Retrieved top 5 customers who have placed the highest total quantity of orders.
2. Calculated average price of products for each product category.
3. Retrieved customers who have not placed any orders.
4. Retrieved order details (OrderID, ProductName, Quantity) for orders placed by customers whose names start with 'M'.
5. Calculated total revenue generated from all orders.
6. Retrieved customer names along with total revenue generated from their orders.
7. Retrieved customers who have placed at least one order for each product category.
8. Retrieved customers who have placed orders on consecutive days.
9. Retrieved top 3 products with the highest average quantity ordered.
10. Calculated percentage of orders that have a quantity greater than the average quantity.

Task 3: Advanced Business Insights
1. Retrieved customers who have placed orders for all products.
2. Retrieved products that all customers have ordered.
3. Calculated total revenue generated from orders placed in each month.
4. Retrieved products that have been ordered by more than 50% of the customers.
5. Retrieved top 5 customers who have spent the highest amount of money on orders.
6. Calculated running total of order quantities for each customer.
7. Retrieved top 3 most recent orders for each customer.
8. Calculated total revenue generated by each customer in the last 30 days.
9. Retrieved customers who have placed orders for at least two different product categories.
10. Calculated average revenue per order for each customer.
11. Retrieved customers who have placed orders for every month of a specific year.
12. Retrieved customers who have placed orders for a specific product in consecutive months.
13. Retrieved products that have been ordered by a specific customer at least twice.

Impact and Conclusion

This project has significantly enhanced my skills in database design, SQL querying, and data management practices crucial for business analytics and customer relationship management.
